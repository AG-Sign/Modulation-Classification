# Modulation-Classification

•A synthetic dataset, generated with GNU Radio, consisting of 11 modulations. This
is a variable-SNR dataset with moderate LO drift, light fading, and numerous
different labeled SNR increments for use in measuring performance across different
signal and noise power scenarios.

•For rest of details, feel free to look up [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0CIyWSs_phxS11Z-AWTTHAQB_3_HEPVDpslf27z7K8/edit)

•There is some [Checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dtusqa3qK-q5tBVHsOrVaF7onLOj8sAu) for RNN, CNN and LSTM runs
